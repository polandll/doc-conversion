# Introduction {#about_cql_ref_c .concept}

About using CQL.

All of the commands included in the CQL language are available on the `cqlsh` command line. There are a group of commands that are available on the command line, but are not support by the CQL language. These commands are called `cqlsh` commands. You can run `cqlsh` commands from the command line only. You can [run CQL commands](../cql_using/useAboutCQL.md#accessing-cql) in a number of ways.

This reference covers CQL and `cqlsh` based on the CQL specification 3.3.
