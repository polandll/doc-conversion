# CQL shell commands {#cqlshCommandsTOC}

The CQL shell \(cqlsh utility\) commands.

**Important:** The CQL shell commands described in this section work only within the [cqlsh shell](../cql_using/useStartingCqlshTOC.md) and are not accessible from drivers. CQL shell uses native protocol and the Datastax python driver to execute CQL commands on the connected Cassandra host. For configuration information, see the [Cassandra 3.0 cassandra.yaml](/en/cassandra-oss/3.0/cassandra/configuration/configCassandra_yaml.html) file.

-   **[Starting cqlsh](../../cql/cql_reference/cqlsh.md)**  
Starts the CQL shell interactive terminal with specified options.
-   **[Configuring cqlsh from a file](../../cql/cql_reference/cqlshUsingCqlshrc.md)**  
Customize the CQL shell configuration at start up from a properties file.
-   **[CAPTURE](../../cql/cql_reference/cqlshCapture.md)**  
Appends query results to a file.
-   **[CLEAR](../../cql/cql_reference/cqlshClear.md)**  
Clears the CQL shell terminal window.
-   **[CONSISTENCY](../../cql/cql_reference/cqlshConsistency.md)**  
Determines how many nodes in the replica must respond for the coordinator node to successfully process a non-lightweight transaction during the CQL shell session.
-   **[COPY](../../cql/cql_reference/cqlshCopy.md)**  
Imports and exports CSV data.
-   **[DESCRIBE](../../cql/cql_reference/cqlshDescribe.md)**  
Provides information about the connected Cassandra cluster and objects within the cluster.
-   **[cqlshExpand](../../cql/cql_reference/cqlshExpand.md)**  
Formats query output vertically.
-   **[EXIT](../../cql/cql_reference/cqlshExit.md)**  
Terminates the CQL shell.
-   **[LOGIN](../../cql/cql_reference/cqlshLogin.md)**  
 Switches user accounts without ending the CQL shell session.
-   **[PAGING](../../cql/cql_reference/cqlshPaging.md)**  
Displays query results in 100-line chunks.
-   **[SERIAL CONSISTENCY](../../cql/cql_reference/cqlshSerialConsistency.md)**  
Sets consistency for lightweight transactions \(LWT\).
-   **[SHOW](../../cql/cql_reference/cqlshShow.md)**  
Displays the Cassandra, CQL, and cqlsh versions, session host details, or tracing session details.
-   **[SOURCE](../../cql/cql_reference/cqlshSource.md)**  
Executes a file containing CQL statements.
-   **[TRACING](../../cql/cql_reference/cqlshTracing.md)**  
Enables or disables request tracing for all nodes in the cluster.
