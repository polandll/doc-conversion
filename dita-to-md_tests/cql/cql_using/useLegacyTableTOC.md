# Legacy tables {#useLegacyTableTOC}

How to work with legacy tables.

Legacy tables must be handled differently from currently built CQL tables.

-   **[Working with legacy applications](../../cql/cql_using/useLegacyTables.md)**  
Internally, CQL does not change the row and column mapping from the Thrift API mapping. CQL and Thrift use the same storage engine.
-   **[Querying a legacy table](../../cql/cql_using/useQueryLegacyTables.md)**  

-   **[Using a CQL legacy table query](../../cql/cql_using/useCQL3QueryLegacyTables.md)**  
Using CQL to query a legacy table.
