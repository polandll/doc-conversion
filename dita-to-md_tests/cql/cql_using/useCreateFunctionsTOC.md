# Creating functions {#useCreateFunctionsTOC}

How to create functions.

In Cassandra 3.0, users can create user-defined functions \(UDFs\) and user-defined aggregate functions \(UDAs\). Functions are used to manipulate stored data in queries. Retrieving [results using standard aggregate functions](useQueryStdAggregate.md) are also available for queries.

-   **[Creating user-defined function \(UDF\)](../../cql/cql_using/useCreateUDF.md)**  
 User-Defined Functions \(UDFs\) can be used to manipulate stored data with a function of the user's choice.
-   **[Creating User-Defined Aggregate Function \(UDA\)](../../cql/cql_using/useCreateUDA.md)**  
User-Defined Aggregates\(UDAs\) can be used to manipulate stored data across rows of data, returning a result that is further manipulated by a final function.
