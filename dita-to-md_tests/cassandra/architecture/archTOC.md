# Understanding the architecture {#archTOC}

Important topics for understanding Cassandra.

-   **[Architecture in brief](../../cassandra/architecture/archIntro.md)**  
Essential information for understanding and using Cassandra.
-   **[Internode communications \(gossip\)](../../cassandra/architecture/archGossipAbout.md)**  
Cassandra uses a protocol called gossip to discover location and state information about the other nodes participating in a Cassandra cluster.
-   **[Data distribution and replication](../../cassandra/architecture/archDataDistributeAbout.md)**  
How data is distributed and factors influencing replication.
-   **[Partitioners](../../cassandra/architecture/archPartitionerAbout.md)**  
A partitioner determines how data is distributed across the nodes in the cluster \(including replicas\).
-   **[Snitches](../../cassandra/architecture/archSnitchesAbout.md)**  
A snitch determines which datacenters and racks nodes belong to.
